# Contributing

Contributing to this project is quite simple:

If you have an issue or want to request a feature, [create a new issue](https://github.com/xdevs23/anymacro/issues/new)

In case you want to add a feature, fix a bug, or whatever you'd like to do, fork the project, make your changes, commit and push them, then create a pull request and briefly explain what the change does.
